# Gemini Quizzify API

**Gemini Quizzify API** is an advanced API designed to generate quiz questions and answers in JSON format. It supports six types of questions: **Multiple Choice**, **True/False**, **Open/Ended**, **Relate Concepts**, **Fill in the Blank**, and **Math**. This API is built to handle multimodal inputs, working with over 16 file types such as **PDF**, **TXT**, **Word**, **Excel**, **Images**, and **YouTube videos**. The API leverages a **few-shot learning approach** to enhance the quality and relevance of the quiz responses generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM). This project was developed by **Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos** using modern AI tools and libraries to ensure high accuracy and flexibility.

## 1. Features

**Gemini Quizzify API** offers a powerful set of features to handle various types of quiz questions and allows integration with multimodal file types for data input. The main features include:

- **Six Question Types**: Support for a wide range of question formats (Multiple Choice, True/False, Open/Ended, Relate Concepts, Fill in the Blank, and Math).
- **Few-shot Learning**: Enhances the generation of relevant and accurate questions using few-shot examples for better contextual understanding.
- **Multimodal Support**: Capable of processing different file types such as PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, images, and YouTube videos.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes **Google Generative AI** through the **Langchain** framework for natural language understanding and quiz generation.
- **ChromaDB**: A powerful vector database for storing and retrieving content, enabling efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for high-quality responses.
- **FastAPI**: Fast, reliable, and scalable API framework for serving quiz generation requests.

## 2. Supported Question Types

The **Gemini Quizzify API** supports the following question types, allowing educational platforms and other use cases to generate various forms of quizzes:

- **Multiple Choice**: The API generates multiple-choice questions with a set of possible answers, where only one is correct.
- **True/False**: Binary questions where the user selects whether the statement is true or false.
- **Open/Ended**: Questions that require a free-text response, allowing users to provide detailed answers.
- **Relate Concepts**: Questions where users must relate or match different concepts based on their understanding.
- **Fill in the Blank**: Questions where users must complete a sentence or paragraph by filling in the missing words.
- **Math**: Mathematical questions that include numerical problem-solving or equation-based answers.

## 3. Technologies Used

**Gemini Quizzify API** is built using the following cutting-edge technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for building the backend services and integrations.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python, known for its performance and simplicity.
- **Langchain**: A framework that integrates Language Models (LLMs) with tools such as Google Generative AI to enable quiz generation based on input data.
- **Google Generative AI**: A powerful language model that helps in generating quiz questions, answers, and relevant content.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database that supports semantic search and retrieval of data, facilitating efficient question generation through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **RAG Pipeline**: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that combines a retrieval mechanism from ChromaDB with few-shot examples to enhance the generation of questions.

## 4. Multimodal Capabilities

The API is designed to process and generate quiz content from a variety of file formats, allowing users to upload educational materials or references in different formats. Supported file types include:

- **Text Files**: PDF, TXT, Word documents (DOCX), and Markdown (MD).
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel files (XLS, XLSX), Google Sheets.
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, and other common image formats.
- **Video**: YouTube links and video files for extracting quiz content from multimedia sources.

These multimodal capabilities ensure that the API can process diverse educational content and generate quiz questions tailored to the format of the provided materials.

## 5. How the RAG Pipeline Works

The **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline is a key component of the **Gemini Quizzify API**. This pipeline enhances quiz generation by retrieving relevant content from ChromaDB and using it as input for Google Generative AI to generate quiz questions. Here’s how it works:

1. **Data Input**: The user provides a file (e.g., PDF, TXT, video, etc.) as input to the API.
2. **Content Extraction**: The relevant text or data is extracted from the provided file using Langchain’s multimodal processing capabilities.
3. **Retrieval**: ChromaDB is queried to retrieve similar examples or context from stored documents, improving the relevance of the questions.
4. **Few-shot Learning**: The API utilizes few-shot learning, incorporating a small number of examples into the prompt to Google Generative AI.
5. **Question Generation**: Google Generative AI generates the quiz questions and answers based on the extracted and retrieved content.
6. **JSON Response**: The API returns the generated quiz questions in a well-structured JSON format.
